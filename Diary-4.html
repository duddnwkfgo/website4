                    <p>
<br><br>
I have made my very first anime. It took me a lot more than I had expected. There were a lot of things that I needed to draw. And at first, I was just tracing other anime characters and tweaked here and there to “steal” some of their style. Then I realized that I will go nowhere in terms of developing my own drawing skills if I were to do that. Tracing per se isn’t bad. But I guess, it’s not a great long-term solution when I want to draw and make original contents on my own. So anyways, the plan was to finish production by Saturday and upload it on Sunday. But it got delayed and I was only able to upload the video on Tuesday. And it was quite mindboggling how much time I needed to make that less-than-7-minute-animation-with-no-animation. It wasn’t the lack of time management that was delaying my process. Also, I was not procrastinating. Throughout the week, the goal of uploading the animation on Sunday was always in my mind and I was continuously making effort every day on that week to achieve that goal. The problem was the lack of experience and knowledge. At first, I wanted to make an anime explaining how this world is very similar to the Pokemon world, in the sense that there’s EV (effort value) and IV (individual value), in which there are some natural talents – IV in the world of pokemon- that people are just born with. Hopefully, I can make this into an episode later. 
<br><br>
So that was my original plan until I realized that I don’t have time to draw all the cuts that I want in a week nor the skills to do so. That’s what I mean by the lack of knowledge and experience. Because I literally had 0 experiences making an animation, I had no idea what I was capable and how much time is needed to provide certain quality of the content. 
<br><br>
Only a handful of master pieces are made only after thousands of scrapped ideas and failures. So when I realized that “I suck” as I have said in my video, I’ve just decided to own the failure –and not running away from it. A Youtube Channel Extracredit describes this as “fail fast”, in a sense that numerous failures are required in order to make something good. If you are going to fail anyway, might as well fail fast and learn your lessons so that you can make something really good the next time. So that’s what I did. 
<br><br>
There are many things I’ve learned with my very first animation. 
<br><br>
One: I suck at drawing.
<br><br>
Two: So I should reduce the scale my project – so going forward, I won’t draw drawing the backgrounds unless it is absolutely necessary. Actually on this point, I find it hilarious because I used to sneer at all these Youtube animations without any backgrounds, saying stuff like “Look at these lazy bastards who skip on background like they skip on a leg-day” I still don’t know why people would skip a leg-day but I sure do know why they skip on backgrounds. 
<br><br>
Three: The deadline for production should be Saturday, not Sunday. It’s because a) it gives me some buffer if things just get out of my hand and take forever and b) so that I can have a full day for quality management such as redoing a line of a voice dub if I don’t like my voice-recording 
<br><br>
Four:  Uh, let’s embrace failures. Who cares if I suck now when I know I will only get better day after day.
<br><br>
So yeah, those are some of the lessons I’ve learned from making the very first animation. I will work on my next one so that I can get it done by Saturday. And means … uh… I don’t have time. Geez. Time to hustle! 
<br><br>
Thanks for reading my diary, you creep. 
<br><br>
Cheers,
<br><br>
It’s your boy Jinboi
